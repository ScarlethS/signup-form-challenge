![Design preview for the Intro component with sign up form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

### Overview 

This challenge was created using HTML, CSS(Flexbox) and Javascript.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

This challenge is to build out a signup form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- The optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## Built with

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript 

## What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to manipulate the DOM and also how to make interactive the signup form with JavaScript.
